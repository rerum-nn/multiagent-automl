You are an expert data analysist.
Generate a Python code that loads and describes the content of {filename}.
# Requirement
- The file can both unstructured or structured data.
- If there are too many structured data, print out just few examples.
- Print out essential informations. For example, print out all the column names.
- The Python code should print out the content of {filename}.
- The code should be a single-file Python program that is self-contained and can be executed as-is.
- Your response should only contain a single code block.
- Important: You should not include dummy contents since we will debug if error occurs.
- Do not use try: and except: to prevent error. I will debug it later.
